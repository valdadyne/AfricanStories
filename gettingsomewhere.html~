    <h3><c>Getting Somewhere</c> </h3>
    <h3><c>Lilian A. Aujo</c> </h3>
     You are a boy of ten again. You are on the bus, and the trees seem to be going faster than the bus
you are seated in. You are on the Kampala–Masaka Highway. You cannot wait to reach Kampala as
it will be your first time there. The excitement darts through your body like grasshoppers jumping
from grass blade to grass blade. You keep standing to catch a glimpse of the speeding trees, and
then sitting down heavily onto your mother’s lap as if you are falling into a chair padded with
cushions.
 “But Vincent, why don’t you settle down?! You will even break my bones! Now see...” Your
mother points down to the heavy lemon green sash of her gomesi. Its tassels are trailing on the bus
floor, covered in red soil.
 “You see how you have dirtied my musiipi? You know gomesis are very hard to clean!”
You look at her attire covered in bright greens, blues and oranges. Mzee bought it for her last
Christmas. It is the newest of all her attires and that is why she has chosen to wear it for the journey
to the big city.
 “Sorry Mama!” You sit on her, as carefully as a butterfly perching on a flower and so that you
remember to remain seated you cross your legs.
 The bus stops at the roadside. A swarm of men balancing baskets of gonja race towards it, covering
the bus’ windows. Your mother buys ten fingers for two hundred shillings. They are yellow and
soft, but crusted brown in some places. As your mother hands you one, its aroma fills your nostrils.
You open your mouth to sink your teeth into it, but the gonja disappears! You start to ask your
mother about it, but stop because she is not there anymore. Yet, you are still on the bus.
 You touch your chin and it is rough with a beard. You look down at your feet and they have
grown so long. Your shorts are gone and you’re wearing trousers.
 “Vinnie, Vinnie ...” It’s Chantal’s sweet voice. But she sounds so far off...You let her voice get
carried away in the loud swish of the speeding trees...And you still have to find your mother...
You follow her through the narrow bus corridor and call out to her but she does not stop. You
continue to follow her, until all the faces on the bus meld into a smooth blackness. But her bright
gomesi creates a shining path for you and you keep going till you reach her and pull at it. But when
she turns she is as still as stone and before you hear the villager mourners wail, “Woowe, Woowe”, you
know there is not one breath left in her...
 “Maama, Maama...”
 “Vinnie, Vinnie! Wake up! It’s just a bad dream!”
You open your eyes. Chantal is staring down at you. “You were dreaming,” she says. Her voice
soothes you. She strokes your ear and says, “Good morning, love?” She heard you whimpering like
a puppy in agony. You turn away, you don’t want her to see the fear in your eyes. But she snuggles
close to you and you have no choice but to kiss her. She is weak and yielding and you are no longer
the scared twelve year old boy staring at your mother’s lifeless body.
 The vibration of the telephone under your pillow tears you away from Chantal. Even as you pull
away from her you wonder who could be calling you at six in the morning. Early morning calls
usually convey very bad news. You wish the superstitious streak in you could be thwarted by
reason. But your fingers tremble as you grip the cell phone. Quickly, you glance at the caller ID.
It’s your father. At this time of the morning, what could be the matter?

 “Hello, Mzee?”
 “Hello Mutabaani, how is Kampala? How is work?”
 “It is Ok. Is everything at home fine?”
 “It would be Ok. But some things are not so good.”
Your heart pounds in your ears. “Has anyone died? Are the twins fine?”
 “It is nothing like that, they are all fine. No one has died.”
Your breath comes out in a low whistle and it’s only then you realised that you’ve been holding it
in.
 “It is just that I had to catch you before you went to work, that is why I called so early.” He sounds
apologetic and you are too relieved to blame him for giving you a scare.
 “So what has happened?”
 “Netaaga obuyambi, mutabani.”
 Your father’s voice suddenly sounds small. You immediately know it’s about money. If he is
asking you, he must have run out of options.
“Yes Mzee, what kind of help?” Damn! That only sounds like you are waiting for him to beg you for
money. You wait for him to say something, but the silence between the lines stretches on.
 “Yes Mzee…” You let your voice trail off like you are waiting for him to complete your thought,
but you’re really thinking he will not become less of a father just because he is about to ask you for
money. It works because he finally fills the space.
 “Nze mbade ngamba...”
 “Yes Mzee...”
 “Joel ne Genevieve, badayo kusomeero.”
 It has to be about that. Your siblings are going back to school. On more than one occasion, you
have ‘topped up’ their school fees. Your father does the best he can. But he is a retired primary
school teacher and does not have much income.
 “How much is the balance?”
 “Millioni taano,” your father says.
 “Five million!” the shock in your voice rings out loud in your own ears; your father hears it too.
 “Naanti my son, you know how things have been. The pension has still not yet come. Even if it
had, it would not have made much of a difference. And the crop has been bad since last year; this
banana wilt destroyed at least three quarters of the plantations.”
 You shake your head. Five ma? Where are you going to get that much money? Chantal wraps her
arms round your waist and puts her soft lips on your cheek in a silent peck. You know your father is
up against the wall. Ten years into retirement and his pension is still held up because the social
security official said he was not one and the same person – just because his name has two different
spellings.
 You know the banana wilt must be as bad as the Ministry of Agriculture had announced. There
was an outbreak in the country, it spread easily and was hard to contain. It has eaten up many
plantations in Masaka, Mzee’s being among.
 But five million! Who is going to give you that much at such short notice? You could take a loan.
 “When do you need the money?”
 “By Friday, son. Joel and Genevieve will be reporting on Monday, and they’ll not be allowed to
register unless they have paid full tuition.”
 Today is Monday. You have only four days to get the money together, a loan approval would take
more than a week. “Eeh! I wish you had told me earlier.”
 “Our SACCO was supposed to lend me some money, but I just got the news that they can’t afford
to lend so much money to one person when money is so scarce.”

 The Savings and Credit Cooperative Organisation your father is referring to, is for the matooke
plantation owners in Masaka. The credit crunch again. The heavily made-up news anchor on last
night’s news talked in detail on how banks and other financial institutions were lax to lend; deposits
are few, so lending rates are high.
 You stare at the light filtering in through the chink in the curtains. It’s mocking you. You do not
see even a sliver of hope to make this problem go away.
 “So Mzee, let me see what to do, I will give you a call in one hour.”
 “Weebale Mutaabani!”
 “Mzee, do not thank me yet, thank me when I get the money.” Even as you say it, you know there
is no hope of you getting that money in four days. You run your fingers over the black metallic
rosary beads hanging from your neck. You never take it off. You never know when the Virgin Mary
might intercede. “Hail Mary, full of grace...” you mumble under your breath. You extricate
yourself from Chantal’s grasp and start to throw off the covers.
 “Can’t you stay a little longer?” She purrs.
 “It is six thirty, I don’t want to be late for work.” The words are thrown over your shoulders
because you are already fastening your towel round your waist, heading for the bathroom.

 “Musiiru gwe! Wayigira wa okuvuga?”
 “What about you! Where did you learn how to drive?” You retort. The taxi driver looks at you
like he would a stray dog and gears. The jolt of annoyance that has been bubbling in you simmers as
you take in his dishevelled appearance His head looks like a millet field after a ghastly downpour,
the guy obviously thinks the existence of combs is a nuisance. His beard looks rough enough to
shame Chantal’s pumice stone. His shirt collar edges are frayed upwards, and there are little black
holes sprinkled down its front – ash burns.
 About two hundred metres away, the traffic policeman’s uniform gleams white in your view. You
think of pressing on in the right lane and allowing the taxi guy to fidget in the nonexistent third one
till the traffic guy pulls him over. But you change your mind as you realise the errant driver will not
give up. He has the nose of his mini bus pointing diagonally at the body of your Japanese Premeau;
the blasted guy will scratch you if you insist. A long winded argument will ensure on who is right
or who is wrong, and the traffic guy will come up and pull both of you over to ‘negotiate’ the
terms of your offence and to decide who is liable for whose car’s repairs. The digital clock on your
dashboard is flashing 7:15 AM in neon green.
 You step on the brake pedal long enough to let the taxi guy into your lane. The Prado behind you
honks with impatience; everyone has somewhere to go this morning.

 “Ki Vincent! You look like you didn’t sleep at all! How is Chantal?” Gerald lowers his spectacles
and stares at you in mock observation. You only shake your head and smile. “She is fine! But she
isn’t the reason I didn’t sleep. Problems never end...” You stare at the blue-white logo of the
company. The motto in bright blue seems to step off the cream walls of your small office: GET
SOMEWHERE: INSURE WITH US.
 “What problems now? A single guy like you should not have problems! Leave them to us who are
married and have families to think about.”
 Although you are about the same age, Gerald is already married and has a five year old daughter.
 “You know how it is; just because I’m not married doesn’t mean I don’t have responsibilities.”
 “So how is Mzee?” Gerald asks. You have been friends for long and he knows how much your
family means to you.
 “He is fine. It is just that we need money; the twins are going for their last semester. By Friday,
everything should be paid and Mzee does not have the money now. He asked me for five ma!”
 “Five million! Hah! That is tight! How are you going to get that money in four days?”
 You shake your head from side to side – you wish your mother was still alive, she always had a
way of taking care of things – “I don’t know! Borrowing here and there I guess! Maybe you can lend
me something...”
 “My pockets are dry too! I just paid my daughter’s school fees. That ‘cheap’ nursery school is
actually expensive. I wonder how much I will have paid by the time she gets to university!”
 “You ask me! That five ma doesn’t even cover all their expenses! Education is so expensive, yet we
earn so little.”
 “I know! How many times have we thought of quitting this insurance thing for better jobs?”
 You and Gerald are both graduates of social sciences. But somehow, you found jobs as sales
executives at a local insurance firm.
 “Maybe if the better jobs were there, we would actually quit,” you reply.
 “But they’re not there! About the money, I doubt many people have much to spare. Since it’s the
beginning of the school term, you should try Katumwa.”
“But he is a shark and his rates are through the roof!”
 Katumwa is your colleague in accounts. To ‘get somewhere’ in life, he runs an ‘underground’
money lending business. He is not as bad as the other loan sharks around town. You have heard
stories of people ‘getting’ fatal accidents because of failing to pay off their debts in time. But you
have not heard anything bad about Katumwa. Then again, who knows?
 “Maybe so, but he is your best bet,” Gerald says, “I don’t see any bank giving you that money at
such short notice, and of course the other money lenders...”
 “...I know,” you interrupt Gerald, “...they’re out of the question...they are more dangerous than
a colleague, but still you never know...”
 You are thinking that if you fail to pay up, Katumwa might send you to jail. But if you fail to find
the money, that will be the end for the twins. A brief picture of your mother’s lifeless face flashes
in front of your eyes. It is just like the last day you saw her in that coffin – the life seeped from her
body, but her bright gomesi strangely vibrant and full of life. The twins were just two when she
died. She might be helpless to help the twins, but you’re not.
 “Too late to go to the bank now,” you repeat, as if you are thinking it for the first time. “Let me go
see Katumwa, before the boss gets here.” You do not know when you started to think of Katumwa
as the ‘Little Shark’. In a strange way the name comforts and fills you with dread at the same time.
 “Do not forget the boss wants the field report and the returns on his desk,” Gerald adds.
 “Yes, they’re almost ready,” you say as you shut the door to the small office you share with
Gerald. As you go through the brightly lit corridor to Little Shark’s office, you touch the flash disk
in your pocket – at least you have most of the work there, and another copy of it on your laptop at
home.
 You rap softly at his door, his office is at the end of the corridor. The joke round office is that
Little Shark always has his ears peeled to a knock that needs ‘economic redemption’.
 “Come in!” His shrill voice cuts through the door.
 As you turn the silver door handle your grip slips because your hands are so clammy with sweat.
You wipe your hands on the flanks of your trousers, and furtively look through the corridor
hopping to God that no one has seen you feeling your buttocks at the threshold of Little Shark’s 
10
door. You finally manage to turn the door handle with both hands. You walk in with the mind that
the door is a minute trap door that will only reveal itself once you pay up.
 “Good morning Katumwa, I need your help!”
 “Vincent! First things first, you never come to see me! You only remember me in hard times,
ehh?”
 You look at his short forearms supporting his burly face. How can such a small man have so much
power? As if he is following your train of thought, Little Shark smiles and says, “How much do you
need?”
 “Five million.”
 “That is Ok. When do you want it? You know the usual rate, right?”
 “As soon as yesterday; ten percent, isn’t it?”
 “My friend, if I lent at that rate, I would never get anywhere. You know the economy is tight, my
rate is fourteen percent. Some other guys in the business are charging fifteen percent every month.”
 “Over a hundred thousand a month? Katumwa, you will kill me!” Before your eyes, the light in his
office dims. Manically, he raps his chubby fingers over the calculator keys.
 “Let’s see...that is just about right; five hundred and twenty-five thousand shillings in three
months.”
 “In three months! That is so much...”
 “...We can talk six months if you want...”
 “Out of the question! So you can milk me for twice the amount?”
 Not in the least bit offended, Little Shark chuckles, “It’s the times my friend, and this is business.”
 You shake your head and touch your neck. The black beads of your rosary feel like a chokehold,
“Fine. I’ll take it.”
 He springs off his desk with a quickness that surprises you. For the first time you notice the steel
safe mounted in the wall in the corner of the room. His chubby fingers deftly turn the knob for the
combination. It’s like he knew you were coming. He takes out five bundles of fifty thousand notes.
He walks over to the counting machine and runs it. It’s all there. He bands it and wraps it in hard
khaki paper and tapes the edges. He hands you a grey box package.
 “Good doing business with you,” Little Shark says.
 You nod, thinking about the ride to the bank. As you reach the door, he is already bending over
his notebook. You turn back to see what he is writing.
 “There is a receipt for you of course,” he says as he opens a drawer on his left. He pulls out a
receipt book and writes out one for you.
***
 “The money is in your account, Mzee.” You are on phone with your father. It is three o’clock and
you are exiting the bank.
 “Eeh! Weebale nnyo mutabaani! Thank you very much son,” he repeats in English. “It is good to have
a son who is somewhere, at least your brother and sister will not drop out, they will get
somewhere too one day, not so mutabaani?”
 “Yes Mzee, they will get somewhere too.”
 As you hang up the phone, you wonder where that somewhere will be.
